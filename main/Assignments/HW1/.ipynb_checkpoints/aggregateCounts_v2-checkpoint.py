"""
This script reads word counts from STDIN and aggregates
the counts for any duplicated words.

INPUT & OUTPUT FORMAT:
    word \t count
USAGE (standalone):
    python aggregateCounts_v2.py < yourCountsFile.txt

Instructions:
    For Q7 - Your solution should not use a dictionary or store anything   
             other than a single total count - just print them as soon as  
             you've added them. HINT: you've modified the framework script 
             to ensure that the input is alphabetized; how can you 
             use that to your advantage?
