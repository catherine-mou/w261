    "Welcome to Machine Learning at Scale! This first homework assignment introduces one of the core strategies in distributed processing: divide and conquer. We'll use the simplest of tasks, word counting, to illustrate the difference between a scalable and non-scalable algorithm. You will be working with the text of _Alice in Wonderland_ to put these ideas into practice using Python and Bash scripting. By the end of this week you should be able to:\n",
    "* ... __describe__ the Bias-Variance tradeoff as it applies to Machine Learning.\n",
    "* ... __explain__ why we consider word counting to be an \"Embarrassingly Parallel\" task.\n",
    "* ... __estimate__ the runtime of embarrassingly parallel tasks using \"back of the envelope\" calculations.\n",
    "* ... __implement__ a Map Reduce algorithm using the Command Line.\n",
    "* ... __set-up__ a Docker container and know why we use them for this course.\n",

    "You will also  become familiar (if you aren't already) with `defaultdict`, `re` and `time` in Python, linux piping and sorting, and Jupyter magic commands `%%writefile` and `%%timeit`. __Please refer to the `README` for detailed submission instructions__.\n",
    "\n",

For example, you might choose to remove punctuation or to consider punctuation symbols  'tokens' in their own right. __In this question you'll use the Python `re` module to create a tokenizer to use when you perform WordCount on the _Alice In Wonderland_ text.__\n",

The bash script itself served as our '_framework_' -- it split up the original input, then ___mapped___ our word counting script on to each chunk, then ___aggregated (a.k.a. reduced)___ the resulting files by piping them into our collation script.  Unfortunately, as you may have realized already, there is a major scalability concern with this particular implementation. __In this question you'll fix our implementation of parallel word count so that it will be scalable.__\n",

If the vocabulary is too large to fit on a single computer, we might split the word counts in half after sorting them, then perform the reducing on two separate machines.

That way you can ensure that all 'duplicated' words would end up in the same machine for the 'reduce' step."

    "> __a)__ The two features of an 'ideal algorithm' are the scalability in terms of data and in terms of resources. For a data perspective, an algorithm should be able to run twice as much data in no more than twice the amount of time. Similarly, given twice the resources (i.e., cluster size), an ideal algorithm should runs at least twice as fast. Furthermore, these scalability features should hold true over a wide range of settings and with no need to change any of the algorithm's parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __b)__ In the case for this simple algorithm, and for the bounds given here (1, 2, and 4 partitions), the algorithm does get close to meeting Lin and Dyer's criteria. But it falls short. Under Lin and Dyer's criteria, one would expect that increasing the Partitions from 1 to 4 would mean the total time would be reduced by at least 1/4. However, in this case it reduced from 4.46s to 1.23s, not to 1.115s. \n",

    "\n",
    "> __c)__ When looking at the algorithm for our Word Count analysis, the criteria for an ideal algorithm does not hold. There are several elements at play here. First, the time unit is much about an order of magnitude smaller than the example above. This means that any communication costs increase with the higher number of partitions and it has a impact on the total time, given that they are in microseconds. This communication cost was probably not as evident on the previous example as the algorithm was not optimized, making the processing time of each individual process be the dominant factor. In the example, that does not happen, and the communication costs does have a visible impact on the overall times. We see that 2 or 4 partitions is about the ideal number. More partitions than that and the communications costs start to take over and dominate the total time. \n",

    "> __a)__ An Embarrissingly Parallel problem is one that can be separated out into multiple parallel tasks with little to no effort. In the case of word count, a text can be easily divided into smaller 'pieces' and each piece can be processed independently of one another. That's an example of an Embarrassingly Parallel problem. The term refers to a 'task', meaning that the tasks of counting words, for example, lends itself to have independent, smaller chunks to be processed. \n",
    "\n",
    "> __b)__ For any functions that are associative commutative, the problem becomes and Embarrassingly Parallel one. That is becuase of the properties associated with these two terms. A commutative problem is one where $(a+b)=(b+a)$. An associated problem is one where $(a+b)+c=a+(b+c)$. This two properties guarantee an Embarrassingly Parallel operation since the problem can be broken down and put together in different order with no impact to the ouput. "
